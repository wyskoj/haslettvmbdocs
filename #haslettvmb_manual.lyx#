\begin_layout Standard
In this main part of the book, each fundamental, in ideal chronological
 teaching order, is presented in full detail.
 Before we begin, I want to provide a definition for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marching maneuver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and how they differ:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Fundamental A skill demonstrated on the marching field that is used in more
 complex maneuvers and is generally found commonly in a marching show.
 For example, every marching show will (hopefully) include 
\emph on
Attention, Roll Step, 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
Mark Time
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Marching
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

maneuver A set of fundamentals applied together to achieve a visual or audible
 effect on the field.
 For example, 2017's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the most rudimentary fundamentals that the band should absolutely
 be comfortable with and can execute with perfection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Attention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Attention
\noun default
 is the most rudimentary fundamental of any, since the band will be holding
 this position for the majority of the time.
 Therefore it is most absolutely necessary the band can do this perfectly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of 
\emph on
holding Attention
\emph default
 is to allow the band to appear uniform when arranged together, whether
 it is on the practice field practicing fundamentals, on the field marching
 a show, walking at an 
\emph on
Attention Walk
\emph default
, or marching in 
\emph on
Parade Block
\emph default
.
 When the band is not uniform, it is simply unappealing to look at; noticing
 a person swaying side to side, itching their leg with their foot, or looking
 around, can break the aesthetic of a marching band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to realize the word choice of

attention.

The goal of Parade Rest is to allow the band to remain uniform, while also
 resting.
 It requires less work to hold than Attention.
 Parade Rest is used commonly when the band is waiting for an event to happen,
 so that the band can return to Attention and continue marching.
 For example, while waiting for the clock to strike 00:00 for halftime,
 the band will hold Parade Rest to appear uniform while not specifically
 being in formation.

The toes of the foot are to remain planted on the ground, from the very
 end of the toe, to just before the arch of the foot.
 The heel of the foot is to raise up and be above the ground about the diameter
 of a tennis ball (30⁰).
 The knee should bend outwards from its position, already unlocked and slightly
 bent.
 Everything from the waist up should remain absolutely motionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To mark time, alternate moving the leg to this position and back to normal
 Attention leg.
 As you move your left foot down, raise your right foot, effectively alternating
 between each leg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most important aspect of marking time is keeping your upper body motionless.
 If you were to imagine having a glass of water resting on the top of your
 head, you would not want to spill any of the water out of the glass.
 To do this, engage your core and maintain stability in your upper body.
\end_layout

Tips for learning a good Lock-Push:

\begin_layout Itemize
Imagine there is a sticky note on the bottom of your foot that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hi Mom!

 In order for your mom to see the note from the stadium seats, you have
 to raise your toes as high as possible so she can see the note.

The

Roll Step

is the most rudimentary and fundamental way to travel the field.
 It allows the band to move with a standardized look.
 This section will focus on an 8:5 (8 steps for every 5 yards) step size.
 It is common to call the culmination of roll stepping and other maneuvers

Once you have initiated a Step-Off and your left foot is in front of you,
 roll through the entire left foot as you pickup your right foot and place
 it 22.5 inches in front of your left foot, only placing down the heel.
 Then as you roll through your entire right foot, pickup your left foot
 and place the heel 22.5 inches in front of your right foot.
 Alternate feet and you are Roll Stepping! It's like walking, but rolling
 through each step at a fixed distance with no upper body movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We march with step sizes of 22.5 inches, because 8 of these specifically
 defined steps will allow you to travel exactly 5 yards.
 We can also march with different step sizes.

Important things to remember:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The entire upper body shall remain 
\series bold
motionless
\series default
 throughout the Step Off and Roll Stepping.
 Your core will need to be engaged to maintain this stability.
 Squeeze your glutes.
 Imagine there is a glass of water on your head and you can't spill any
 of it.
 You should not move your upper body at all!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rolling through each foot is important for maintaining stability.
 Imagine there is a tube of toothpaste on the ground and you have to use
 your entire foot to squeeze it out from back to front.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The height of your toes must remain as high as possible, just like in the
 step-off.
 This will help you with the rolling action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Why should we keep our upper body still?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is vital that your upper body remain motionless while marching because
 you are also playing an instrument while doing this! Imagine if you were
 to march a show while bouncing up and down, your tone would go up and down
 too! Multiply that by 100 people in the band and now we can't agree that
 A4 = 440 Hz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Guiding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Guiding 
\noun default
is one of the most important fundamentals to execute, since it allows the
 band to appear uniform.
 The idea of guiding is to keep forms straight.
 For example, when in fundamental block, you are in a row with everyone
 else in your section, and it is not going to look good if everyone is slightly
 offset from each other.
 Instead of a straight line, we have a wavy line!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to fix this is to guide.
 By guiding, you keep your body in line with the person on your right.
 You will always guide to the person on your right.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are exceptions to this but they are less common.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you are in a form where there are also people in front of you, you will
 also guide forwards, making sure you are in line with the person to your
 right and the person in front of you.
 Imagine keeping your shoulders on an imaginary axis that is perfectly in
 line with your guides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Responses in Fundamental Block
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When marching in fundamental block, the band will shout responses when hitting
 subdivisions of marching lengths.
 The response varies depending on the direction of travel:

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Half way between yard lines (when the right foot is placed down):

Bend your knees slightly more than the unlocked position for attention to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To switch to going backwards from marching forwards, at the time of the
 rock and roll, the right foot will be placed down like a normal roll step.
 However, when the foot is placed down, the weight of the body is going
 to roll through the foot and move to the ball of the foot, then the left
 foot is raised to be on the balls, effectively placing the performer in
 a perfect backwards march position.

\begin_layout Standard
When performing a left flank, the body will quickly pivot on the ball of
 the right foot and on the heel of the left foot.
 The foot anchorage and rotation is exactly the same as a Facing.
 The rotation of the body will occur on the upbeat of the beat (the

 The upper body should rotate quickly and snappy.

Traversing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Traversing
\noun default
 is marching one direction while having the upper body face a different
 direction, up to 90º left or right.
 It is common to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

traverse home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to allow the band to march one direction and point the instruments towards
 the home sideline for best audio quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traversing involves rotating the upper body so that it is facing one direction,
 while marching in another.
 Therefore, it is important to traverse correctly to reduce the amount of
 strain and tension caused on the spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traversing involves two directions: the 
\emph on
march direction
\emph default
, and the 
\emph on
facing direction
\emph default
.
 The march direction is the direction the performer is marching.
 This could be forwards, backwards, or any angle in between.
 The facing direction is the direction the upper body is facing while marching.
 It is possible for the facing direction to be anywhere within the range
 of –90º to +90º from the direction of the marching direction.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "traversing-never-backwards-at-90"

\end_inset

It should be noted that performers will never march backwards when the facing
 angle is 90º of the marching angle (they will forwards march instead).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To rotate the body to the desired facing direction, the hips should rotate
 half way to the desired angle, then the upper torso should rotate another
 half, resulting in the shoulders above having a net rotation of the desired
 facing rotation.
 For example, if you needed to traverse 90º, your hips will rotate 45º,
 and the upper body will rotate another 45º, resulting in a 90º rotation
 of the upper body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To healthily rotate the upper body, imagine pushing the should behind forwards,
 instead of pulling the forwards shoulder back.
 It is also important to retain a proper posture and provide lower back
 support to reduce strain and soreness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Beginners will experience that they will

 or march oblique to their intended marching path if they are traversing.
 It is simple as just practicing to overcome this habit and remain on track.
 Extra attention must be given to the feet to achieve this.
 It may be helpful to overcompensate when first learning traversing to effective
ly remain the correct path.

Hip Switch

\begin_layout Standard
Performers perform a 
\noun on
Hip Switch
\noun default
 (also known by its response 
\noun on
To the Rear) 
\noun default
when alternating from forwards marching to backwards marching (and vice
 versa) without changing velocity (heading in same direction).
 An example of when this may be used is traverse marching in a circle.
 If the performer must always face towards the home sideline and march in
 a circle, they will have to hip switch on either side of the circle so
 that they can remain marching in the correct direction without turning
 the upper body more than 90º.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The hip switch can be thought of as a 180º flank.
 When doing a hip switch, you will always pivot on your right foot, and
 your left foot will swing around.
 The movement, like all others, is short and snappy.
 After bringing the left foot around, it will either go directly into a
 roll step position or drag toes position, depending on the orientation
 the performer is about to march.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Adjusted Step Size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A performer's step size will not always be a perfect 8:5 (8 steps every

 Certain forms in the show's chart may have performers moving at a different
 speed (by changing step size, the performer's speed is inherently changed

 This means that the distance in between each step will change.

 For a 16:5 (16 steps for every 5 yards), the step distance is 11.25 in.

Making Shapes

\begin_layout Subsection
Box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good way to practice flankings and roll stepping is with a 
\noun on
Box
\noun default
.
 A box consists of three turns, and can be in variable size and direction.
 For example, some valid boxes:
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Boxes in fundamental block will always be square and have an even side length.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
BoxL4 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 — Box with left turns, each side is 4 steps long
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

BoxR8 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Box Right 8
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 — Box with right turns, each side is 8 steps long
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the example of a BoxR8 (pronounced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Box Right 8
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This means that the band will take right turns, and march for 8 steps on
 each side before turning.
 The band will lock-push
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the band begins this box command from a non-stationary position (e.g.,
 marching, another box, etc.), the band will not stop and immediately begin
 the maneuvers for this box.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

and begin marching forwards for 8 steps.
 After 8 steps, the band will Flank right, and take another 8 steps.
 The band will Flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 Finally, the band will flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 The last step before finishing the box is a cheat step.
 The band finishes in the same direction as they started, so, the very last
 step is a flank to rotate back to the initial direction.
 The cheat step helps achieve this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the box had a length of 4 instead of 8, simply only take 4 steps instead
 of 8.
 If the box was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 simply take left flanks instead of right flanks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Traverse Box
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boxes are good for practicing flankings and roll stepping.
 While we practice those fundamentals, we can also practice traversing with
 
\noun on
Traverse Boxes
\noun default
.
 Traverse boxes are just normal boxes, while also traversing in one direction
 the whole time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traverse direction is chosen arbitrarily, as long as the direction can
 be traversed to at the beginning (cannot traverse home sideline when facing
 away).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the traverse box will be backwards marching, one side will be
 forwards marching, and two sides will be traversing.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "traversing-never-backwards-at-90"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, performers will never march backwards when traversing at a 90º.
 They will forwards march while traversing the appropriate direction.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if the band was facing field left, traversing to the home sideline,
 and doing a traverse box left:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first edge of the box will be a forwards march while traversing home
 (upper body rotated right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The band will then backwards flank and march backwards the second edge of
 the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The third edge of the box will be a forwards march while traversing home
 (upper body rotated left).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The final edge of the box will be a forwards march.
 The final step will return the feet to the initial direction ending the
 traverse box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adjusted Boxes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just like how traverse boxes are good for practicing traversing, having
 boxes at adjusted step sizes can help with practicing adjusted steps.
 It is also fun to have the band do a box at one step size, then immediately
 have the band do another box at a different step size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of how adjusted boxes are labeled:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

 A line is a row of performers that begins on the home sideline and extends
 towards the home hash (or further).
 A section leader or other veteran should be the one marching on the sideline,
 so that the general accuracy of the line is maximized.
 For each performer in each line, there is typically 4 steps of distance
 in between (an orange tick).

Squish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes while in Parade Block, the band has to fit within a restricted
 width.
 Examples of this include doorways, sidewalks, etc.
 When 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

squished,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rows are divided and stacked, effectively making the parade longer, but
 more narrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those near the front of the parade will be the first to know that the parade
 must squish.
 They commonly will yell 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

squish!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and those behind them yell it subsequently, effectively sending the message
 to the very back of the parade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Marching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time while in Parade Block, the band will be marching in time
 because the cadence is playing (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:Cadences"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for more information).
 The band should march in time with the current song or cadence.
 Remember, even though we may not be on the field, this should still be
 a roll step to ensure a good playing quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Turns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning in Parade Block requires special attention to maintain the form.
 Because the block consists of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the whole row must maintain a row shape throughout the entire turn.
 To do this, special marching is done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The individual on the inside will march the least distance while turning,
 while the individual on the outside of the turn will march the most? Why
 is this? Imagine each band member is marching on quarter circles (this
 is demonstrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:parade-block-turn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since the circle furthest away from the epicenter of the circle has a larger
 circumference, the member that follows that path must march proportionately
 further.
