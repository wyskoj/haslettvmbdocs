I can't recommend using the tree method, since your distance to a tree can
 affect the angle, and you probably won't have a tree to reference when

 memorize that angle, it may just work for you.

 Parade Rest is used commonly when the band is waiting for an event to happen,

 the band will hold Parade Rest to appear uniform while not specifically

To transition from Attention to Parade Rest, the left arm should quickly
 snap from its position in Attention to Parade Rest.
 The left foot should also move out the left, landing just under the armpit/shou

 The heel of the foot is to raise up and be above the ground about the diameter

 The knee should bend outwards from its position, already unlocked and slightly
 bent.
 Everything from the waist up should remain absolutely motionless.

The most important aspect of marking time is keeping your upper body motionless.
 If you were to imagine having a glass of water resting on the top of your

 Note that the following fundamentals are not directly given via commands,
 but are given through a set of instructions (e.g.,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also introduces 
\emph on
instruction giving

 When command giving, the band immediately responds and does an action when
 a command is given.
 In instruction giving, the band is given a series of commands, given time
 to process them mentally, then the band is given a command to begin.

instruction giving,

 (e.g.,

 When the band has been given instructions, the leader will shout to start
 the instructions given:

Once you have initiated a Step-Off and your left foot is in front of you,
 roll through the entire left foot as you pickup your right foot and place
 it 22.5 inches in front of your left foot, only placing down the heel.
 Then as you roll through your entire right foot, pickup your left foot
 and place the heel 22.5 inches in front of your right foot.
 Alternate feet and you are Roll Stepping! It's like walking, but rolling
 through each step at a fixed distance with no upper body movement.

We march with step sizes of 22.5 inches, because 8 of these specifically

It is vital that your upper body remain motionless while marching because
 you are also playing an instrument while doing this! Imagine if you were

\noun on
Guiding 
\noun default
is one of the most important fundamentals to execute, since it allows the
 band to appear uniform.
 The idea of guiding is to keep forms straight.
 For example, when in fundamental block, you are in a row with everyone
 else in your section, and it is not going to look good if everyone is slightly
 offset from each other.
 Instead of a straight line, we have a wavy line!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to fix this is to guide.
 By guiding, you keep your body in line with the person on your right.
 You will always guide to the person on your right.

 If you are in a form where there are also people in front of you, you will
 also guide forwards, making sure you are in line with the person to your
 right and the person in front of you.
 Imagine keeping your shoulders on an imaginary axis that is perfectly in
 line with your guides.

The 
\noun on

 allows performers to move backwards, unlike roll step which is forwards.
 A different technique is used for marching backwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it was important for rolling through each step for a forwards march,
 it is important to remain on the balls of your feet for a backwards march.
 Backwards march is colloquially called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drag toes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since that is what the technique entails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When marching backwards, always be on the balls of your feet.
 Your heels should not touch the ground in any capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bend your knees slightly more than the unlocked position for attention to
 absorb some shock from dragging your toes on the ground.
 Your upper body should not move at all, just like a roll step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As you move your feet back for each step, imagine tickling the blades of
 the grass on the ground: your feet should have contact with the ground,
 but not be so forceful as to inhibit movement.
 If you were backwards marching in sand, there would be two, straight, parallel
 lines in the sand where your toes dragged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is common for those who are first beginning learning how to backwards
 march to undershoot the distance and fall short of the destination behind
 them.
 It is important to take bigger steps—bigger than you probably think you
 need to—to reach your destination.

 backwards to forwards, without stopping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To switch to going backwards from marching forwards, at the time of the
 rock and roll, the right foot will be placed down like a normal roll step.
 However, when the foot is placed down, the weight of the body is going
 to roll through the foot and move to the ball of the foot, then the left
 foot is raised to be on the balls, effectively placing the performer in
 a perfect backwards march position.

Once rolled through the right foot, it is necessary to not linger in this

When performing a left flank, the body will quickly pivot on the ball of

 The foot anchorage and rotation is exactly the same as a Facing.
 The rotation of the body will occur on the upbeat of the beat (the

), a backwards flank to the left would put the performer's body facing the
 sideline, marching backwards (back field).
 It is a backwards flank because the march direction after the flank was
 backwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other type example is starting with a backwards march.
 For example, when marching backwards perpendicular to the sideline, a backwards
 flank to the right would put the performer's direction of travel field
 right in a forwards march.
 It is a backwards flank because the march direction before the flank was
 backwards.
\end_layout

It is not common for a backwards march backwards flank into a backwards

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traversing involves rotating the upper body so that it is facing one direction,
 while marching in another.
 Therefore, it is important to traverse correctly to reduce the amount of
 strain and tension caused on the spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traversing involves two directions: the 
\emph on
march direction
\emph default
, and the 
\emph on
facing direction
\emph default
.
 The march direction is the direction the performer is marching.
 This could be forwards, backwards, or any angle in between.
 The facing direction is the direction the upper body is facing while marching.
 It is possible for the facing direction to be anywhere within the range
 of –90° to +90° from the direction of the marching direction.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

It should be noted that performers will never march backwards when the facing
 angle is 90° of the marching angle (they will forwards march instead).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To rotate the body to the desired facing direction, the hips should rotate
 half way to the desired angle, then the upper torso should rotate another
 half, resulting in the shoulders above having a net rotation of the desired
 facing rotation.
 For example, if you needed to traverse 90°, your hips will rotate 45°,
 and the upper body will rotate another 45°, resulting in a 90° rotation
 of the upper body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To healthily rotate the upper body, imagine pushing the should behind forwards,
 instead of pulling the forwards shoulder back.
 It is also important to retain a proper posture and provide lower back
 support to reduce strain and soreness.

\begin_layout Itemize
Beginners will experience that they will

 or march oblique to their intended marching path if they are traversing.
 It is simple as just practicing to overcome this habit and remain on track.
 Extra attention must be given to the feet to achieve this.
 It may be helpful to overcompensate when first learning traversing to effective
ly remain the correct path.

when alternating from forwards marching to backwards marching—and vice versa—wit
hout changing velocity (i.e., heading in the same direction).
 An example of when this may be used is traverse marching in a circle.
 If the performer must always face towards the home sideline and march in
 a circle, they will have to hip switch on either side of the circle so
 that they can remain marching in the correct direction without turning
 the upper body more than 90°.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The hip switch can be thought of as a 180° flank.
 When doing a hip switch, you will always pivot on your right foot, and
 your left foot will swing around.
 The movement, like all others, is short and snappy.
 After bringing the left foot around, it will either go directly into a
 roll step position or drag toes position, depending on the orientation
 the performer is about to march.

A good way to practice flankings and roll stepping is with a

 A box consists of three turns, four sides, and can be in variable size

 For example, some valid boxes:

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the example of a BoxR8 (pronounced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Box Right 8
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This means that the band will take right turns, and march for 8 steps on
 each side before turning.
 The band will lock-push
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the band begins this box command from a non-stationary position (e.g.,
 marching, another box, etc.), the band will not stop and immediately begin

\end_layout

\end_inset

and begin marching forwards for 8 steps.
 After 8 steps, the band will Flank right, and take another 8 steps.
 The band will Flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 Finally, the band will flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 The last step before finishing the box is a cheat step.
 The band finishes in the same direction as they started, so, the final
 step is a flank to rotate back to the initial direction.
 The cheat step helps achieve this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the box had a length of 4 instead of 8, simply only take 4 steps instead
 of 8.
 If the box was

 While we practice those fundamentals, we can also practice traversing with

 Traverse boxes are just normal boxes, while also traversing in one direction
 the whole time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traverse direction is chosen arbitrarily, as long as the direction can
 be traversed to at the beginning (cannot traverse home sideline when facing
 away).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One side of the traverse box will be backwards marching, one side will be
 forwards marching, and two sides will be traversing.

, performers will never march backwards when traversing at a 90°.
 They will forwards march while traversing the appropriate direction.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if the band was facing field left, traversing to the home sideline,
 and doing a traverse box left:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first edge of the box will be a forwards march while traversing home
 (upper body rotated right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The band will then backwards flank and march backwards the second edge of
 the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The third edge of the box will be a forwards march while traversing home
 (upper body rotated left).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The final edge of the box will be a forwards march.
 The final step will return the feet to the initial direction ending the
 traverse box.

Turning in Parade Block requires special attention to maintain the form.
 Because the block consists of

rows

 the whole row must maintain a row shape throughout the entire turn.
 To do this, special marching is done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The individual on the inside will march the least distance while turning,
 while the individual on the outside of the turn will march the most.
 Why is this? Imagine each band member is marching on quarter circles (this

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Since the circle furthest away from the epicenter of the circle has a larger
 circumference, the member that follows that path must march proportionately
 further.

You will also be delegating tasks.
 If someone comes up to you and asks you do something that you know a Section

 I personally suck at delegating and ended up doing a lot of stuff, but
 you might find it easier.
 For example, as Drum Major, you might delegate tick painting to band managers
 so you can focus on preparing for what you're going to cover in the next
 section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Keeping the Beat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exist prerequisites to conducting that you must be comfortable with
 before you will be able to conduct.
 You must be able to count to four is a musical fashion (i.e., counting from
 one to four to a given tempo).
 This entails more than you may perceive at face value: the most important
 part of this being able to do this while not having a metronome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Try this example to see what I'm poorly trying to say.
 Get a metronome and set the tempo to ♩ = 100.
 Snap your fingers, clap, or make some audible motion, in sync with the
 metronome for about 4 bars (i.e., 16 beats).
 Then, have someone mute the metronome, but leave it running.
 Keep the beat for another 4 bars without being able to hear the metronome.
 Have the person unmute the metronome when the metronome has clicked for
 4 bars.
 Did your 17th clap line up with the 17th click of the metronome? Uh, oh.
 Looks like you've got some work to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's okay.
 Even the best and most experienced drummers can't 100% of the time keep
 a tempo for an extended period of time.
 But, there exists one simple trick that will allow you improve this ability.

 By subdividing and counting the sixteenth notes instead, your brain has

\begin_layout Standard
When you count 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

one, two, three, four,

The 3/4 pattern is seen in the Star Spangled Banner, the Haslett High School

 Therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first beat is a simple down beat: raise the hands, then hit the ictus
 using wrist motion.
 The hands should bounce off this beat back upwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second beat hits the ictus and bounces away from the body, again upwards
 at a 45° angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third and final beat again hits the ictus and bounces up vertically,
 ready to hit the next beat, which is the first beat in the pattern.

Boom

The boom is a quick and firm—but not intense—punch to the conductor's chest

 On beat 1, instead of conducting the downbeat, the right hand makes a fist

 This punch shouldn't knock back the conductor, but is firm and not floppy.
 The fingers of the fist will rest on the upper chest, knuckles pointing
 up and left.
 This is demonstrated in Figure .

The two triangles show the amount of teacher support (which is you!) and
 student responsibility.
 You read this chart by going from top to bottom.
 You'll notice that the triangles are divided into thirds.
 Each third is “I DO,” WE DO”, and “YOU DO.” And those represent how you
 will move your knowledge of the skill to the student.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with “I DO.” You will begin by naming and demonstrating the fundamental.
 You'll talk about what the fundamental is, as well as when you will use
 this and giving some context.
 Then you can do a demonstration (often, you'll want to use a veteran or
 a Section Leader as the model).
 Start with the end product.
 So, if you're teaching how to stand at Attention, start by showing a proper
 Attention, so that the learner knows approximately what they will look
 like once they've learned it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've shown what it should look like, then you'll want to break it
 down step by step, piece by piece, to explain the details of the skill.
 Go through and explain each part.
 If you're teaching a stationary fundamental, break it down into the parts
 of the body.
 If it involves movement, like moving to Parade Rest, you'll want to do
 this for each move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've broken it down, let them try it.
 Don't give any guidance yet.
 Just let them try it on their own and start to get comfortable with it.
 This is the most important step, and is also the most forgotten.
 You can feel free to keep demonstrating it to help them try it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So by now, we've talked about what you're teaching, what it looks like,
 each component of it, and now they're trying it on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While they're trying it, notice what they're doing right and wrong.
 Pay attention to a few specific areas that you'll want to address.
 Once they've had some time to get comfortable, give some feedback and talk
 about what they're doing well, and what they need to fix to make it perfect!

Blowing the whistle is much similar to that of playing a wind instrument

 Quickly release and repress the tongue on the mouthpiece of the whistle

 Since this is 100% directed by you and your co-Drum Major, I will not provide
 instructions for any specific salute.
 But, I will provide some tips that I learned while designing ours, as well
 as guidelines you should follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't do anything outside of your comfort zone.
 In general, this sounds like bad advice, but it is great advice in the
 context of your salute.
 Anything outside of your comfort zone makes you prone to messing up and
 making a mistake—not ideal.
 Choose some mace fundamentals that both you and your co-Drum Major are
 comfortable with and design your salute around that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You and your co-Drum Major must always be in sync during the salute.
 Now, this does not mean that you both have to do the same thing (staggered
 movements might look cool) at the same time, but your internal tempos must
 absolutely be synchronized.
 Sudden motions must occur at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prop spins—when done incorrectly—can become out of sync very quickly.
 Again, not ideal for a salute.
 If you have issues syncing your prop spins, keep them to a minimum, or
 don't do them at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have issues staying in sync, try gently counting out loud during
 the salute so your co-Drum Major can hear you and align themselves with
 you.
 Don't shout too loud though, or the audience will be able to hear you.

These drills are available to use for practicing certain fundamentals.
 Presented are both computer generated drills, and some specially designed

 The goal of the computer generated drills is to allow drum majors to present
 new content to the band, having an available resource at hand on the field.
