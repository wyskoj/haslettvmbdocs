\begin_layout Chapter
The Field & Where to Be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most—if not the most—important aspects of marching is knowing
 where to march.
 Marching bands make great use of strategically placing performers to convey
 a visual style, compose shapes, and maintain uniformity.
 If the position of each performer is not explicitly defined, the band would
 not have a defined layout.
 Hence, it is important that each band member knows exactly where and when
 to be to maximize visual effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most marching that happens while being a member of the band will occur on
 a football field.
 While the football field is marked and designed for playing football, marching
 bands have found ways to interpret the layout and use it to their advantage
 to design a special coordinate system.
 Through this, each performer can exactly navigate to any defined position
 on the field.
 This chapter will demonstrate how to understand the field to be most familiar
 with it—marching in other places, such as in a parade, is covered in Chapter

Slow horns up and down
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although rare, it is possible to bring the horns up and down slowly.
 This move is also done without a verbal command.
 The last time this technique was performed was in 2017's 
\emph on

 Conductors will place both hands together in a fist and

\end_inset

 an invisible table, then bring their hands up slowly to their ictus.
 During this transition, instruments are slowly risen to the horns up position.
 Because there is no verbal command, it is entirely conducted by visuals.
 This introduced a drawback where anyone who couldn't see a Drum Major would
 not have knowledge of the horns up.
 To combat this, additional conductors were used for the beginning of the
 song at various vantage points.
 This way, all performers had a conductor in sight and would know when horns
 up commenced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For horns down, the horns gradually lower as the hands of the conductors
 lower.

 The heel of the foot is to raise up and be above the ground about the diameter
 of a tennis ball (30°).
 The knee should bend outwards from its position, already unlocked and slightly
 bent.
 Everything from the waist up should remain absolutely motionless.
\end_layout

To mark time, alternate moving the leg to this position and back to normal
 Attention leg.
 As you move your left foot down, raise your right foot, effectively alternating
 between each leg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most important aspect of marking time is keeping your upper body motionless.
 If you were to imagine having a glass of water resting on the top of your

 To do this, engage your core and maintain stability in your upper body.

This also introduces

instruction giving

, contrary to command giving.
 When command giving, the band immediately responds and does an action when
 a command is given.
 In instruction giving, the band is given a series of commands, given time
 to process them mentally, then given a command to begin.

instruction giving,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I'm referring to delivering a set of maneuvers for the band to perform
 (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mark time 8, forwards march 8, and close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) instead of more generic commands (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

).
\end_layout

 So, instruction giving is appended by a command.
 When the band has been given instructions, the leader will shout to start
 the instructions given:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The timing of the syllables forms four even quarter notes of a 4/4 measure,
 landing on beats 1–4.
 Depending on what the band's first move is, they will have a different
 response, but will always give back a response.
 Most times, their response will overlap with the leader's command on beat
 4.

Once you have initiated a Step-Off and your left foot is in front of you,
 roll through the entire left foot as you pick up your right foot and place
 it 22.5 inches in front of your left foot, only placing down the heel.
 Then as you roll through your entire right foot, pick up your left foot
 and place the heel 22.5 inches in front of your right heel.
 Alternate feet and you are Roll Stepping! It's like walking, but rolling
 through each step at a fixed distance with no upper body movement.

We march with step sizes of 22.5 inches because 8 of these specifically defined

The entire upper body shall remain

 Your core will need to be engaged to maintain this stability.
 Squeeze your glutes.
 Imagine there is a glass of water on your head and you can't spill any
 of it.
 You should not move your upper body at all!

Rolling through each foot is important for maintaining stability.
 Imagine there is a tube of toothpaste on the ground and you have to use
 your entire foot to squeeze it out from back to front.

The height of your toes must remain as high as possible, just like in the
 Step-Off.
 This will help you with the rolling action.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Why should we keep our upper body still?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is vital that your upper body remain motionless while marching because
 you are also playing an instrument while doing this! Imagine if you were
 to march a show while bouncing up and down.
 Your tone would go up and down too! Multiply that by 100 people in the
 band and now we can't agree that

\noun on
Guiding 
\noun default
is one of the most important fundamentals to execute since it allows the
 band to appear uniform.
 The idea of guiding is to keep forms straight.
 For example—when in fundamental block and in a row with everyone else in
 your section—it is not going to look good if everyone is slightly offset
 from each other.
 Instead of a straight line, we have a wavy line!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to fix this is to guide.
 By guiding, you keep your body in line with the person on your right.
 You will usually guide to the person on your right, although this depends
 on context.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you are in a form where there are also people in front of you, you will
 also guide forwards, making sure you are in line both with the person to
 your right and the person in front of you.
 Imagine keeping your shoulders on an imaginary axis that is perfectly in
 line with your guides.

\begin_layout Itemize
As you move your feet back for each step, imagine tickling the blades of
 the grass on the ground: your feet should have contact with the ground,
 but not be so forceful as to inhibit movement.
 If you were backwards marching in sand, there would be two, straight, parallel
 lines in the sand where your toes dragged.

To switch to going backwards from marching forwards—at the time of the Rock

 However—when the foot is placed down—the weight of the body is going to

), a backwards flank to the left would put the performer's body facing the
 sideline, marching backwards (back field).
 It is a backwards flank because the march direction after the flank was
 backwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other type example is starting with a backwards march.
 For example, when marching backwards perpendicular to the sideline, a backwards
 flank to the right would put the performer's direction of travel field
 right in a forwards march.
 It is a backwards flank because the march direction before the flank was
 backwards.

Traversing involves rotating the upper body so that it is facing one direction

 Therefore, it is important to traverse correctly to reduce the amount of

Traversing involves two directions: the

It should be noted that performers will never march backwards when the facing
 angle is 90° of the marching angle (they will forwards march instead).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A rare exception exists to this rule: performers must march backwards while
 traversed at 90° when immediately preceded by a forwards march with the
 same facing angle (Rock and Roll).
 Since it is impractical to one-eighty on one beat while maintaining a traversal
, a backwards march is needed until the facing direction changes.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate the body to the desired facing direction, the hips should rotate
 half way to the desired angle, then the upper torso should rotate another
 half, resulting in the shoulders above having a net rotation of the desired
 facing rotation.
 For example, if you needed to traverse 90°, your hips will rotate 45°,
 and the upper body will rotate another 45°, resulting in a 90° rotation
 of the upper body.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some instructors will suggest the thirds rule: divide the angle into thirds
 and apply each third to your knees, hips, and shoulders, effectively turning
 the entire upper body by the full angle.
 I disagree with this method since it often tends to intensify and increase
 error.
 By offsetting the knees, this induces non-ideal kinematics and effectively
 curves the actual marching path away from the target.

To healthily rotate the upper body, imagine pushing the shoulder behind
 forwards, instead of pulling the forwards shoulder back.

 or march oblique to their intended marching path if they are Traversing.
 It is simple as just practicing to overcome this habit and remain on track.
 Extra attention must be given to the feet to achieve this.
 It may be helpful to overcompensate when first learning Traversing to effective
ly maintain the correct path.

Performers perform a

\noun default
 (also known by its response 
\noun on

\noun default
when alternating from forwards marching to backwards marching—and vice versa—wit
hout changing velocity (i.e., heading in the same direction).
 An example of when this may be used is traverse marching in a circle.
 If the performer must always face towards the home sideline and march in
 a circle, they will have to Hip Switch on either side of the circle so
 that they can remain marching in the correct direction without turning
 the upper body more than 90°.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hip Switch can be thought of as a 180° flank.
 When doing a Hip Switch, you will always pivot on your right foot, and
 your left foot will swing around.
 The movement—like all others—is short and snappy.
 After bringing the left foot around, it will either go directly into a
 Roll Step position or Drag Toes position, depending on the orientation
 the performer is about to march.

\begin_layout Standard
A performer's step size will not always be a perfect 8:5 (i.e., 8 steps for
 every 5 yards).
 Certain forms in the show's chart may have performers moving at a different
 speed (by changing step size, the performer's speed is inherently changed).
 To account for this, performers will have to march with an 
\noun on
Adjusted Step Size
\noun default
.
 This means that the distance in between each step will change.
 In an 8:5, the step distance is 22.5 in.
 For a 16:5 (16 steps for every 5 yards), the step distance is 11.25 in.

To adjust from marching in one step size to another, simply begin taking

 After 8 steps, the band will flank right and take another 8 steps.
 The band will flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 Finally, the band will flank right again and take 8 more steps.
 The last step before finishing the box is a cheat step.
 The band finishes in the same direction as they started, so the final step
 is a flank to rotate back to the initial direction.
 The cheat step helps achieve this.

Guiding in a diagonal box

\begin_layout Standard
When marching in a diagonal box, you still have two points of reference
 to guide to (in a normal box you guide right and forwards), but these are
 slightly changed.
 You now guide along the diagonals, front-left and front-right.
 The principle is still the same: ensure that you are forming a straight
 line along those you guide to.

\begin_layout Standard
Turning in Parade Block requires special attention to maintain the form.
 Because the block consists of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the whole row must maintain a row shape throughout the entire turn.
 To do this, special marching is done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The individual on the inside will march the least distance while turning,
 while the individual on the outside of the turn will march the most.
 Why is this? Imagine each band member is marching on quarter circles (this
 is demonstrated in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:parade-block-turn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since the circle furthest away from the epicenter of the circle has a larger
 circumference, the member that follows that path must march proportionately
 further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further prove this, we know that the radius of the quarter circle is
 larger on the outside of the turn.
 The equation relating circumference to radius is 
\begin_inset Formula $C=2\pi r$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 increases, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

 increases.
 Hence, the march distance is larger on the outside of the turn.

It's vital to give tasks to others who don't have the “desk plaque”.
 It helps give them responsibility and a role in managing the band.

Now, this isn't to say that you should be handing all tasks to someone else.
 Realize which tasks are important to delegate and which to take responsibility

I'm not an expert on leadership\SpecialChar endofsentence
 I can only provide to you what I have learned
 throughout my tenure as Drum Major.
 I can't prep you for every situation that may arise, unfortunately.

\begin_layout Standard
If you want more leadership resources, I can recommend to you Dr.
 Matthew Arau, Assistant Professor of Music at Lawrence University in Appleton,
 Wisconsin.
 During the summer of 2019, Ethan and I attended a leadership workshop presented
 by him.
 He gave us a ton of useful knowledge that helped us prepare for the season.
 If you contact him looking for the resources he provides, I'm sure he'd
 be more than happy to provide you as many resources as possible to help
 you succeed.

Another grave aspect of being a Drum Major is 
\noun on
Conducting
\noun default
.
 To put it simply, conducting is the act of synchronizing performers' internal
 tempos, indicating specific musical styles and techniques, and providing
 cues and directions.
 In this section, I hope to provide a start-to-finish walk-through on the
 elements of conducting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, a book can't give you feedback on how your conducting is.
 Make use of your time with the Directors and instructors to shape and polish
 your conducting skills.

Keeping the Beat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Get a metronome and set the tempo to ♩
\begin_inset space ~

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

100.
 Clap in sync with the metronome for 4 bars (i.e., 16 beats).
 Then, have someone mute the metronome, but leave it running.
 Keep the beat for another 4 bars without being able to hear the metronome.
 Have the person unmute the metronome when it has clicked for 4 bars.
 Did your 33rd clap line up with the 33rd click of the metronome? Uh-oh.
 Looks like you've got some work to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's okay.
 Even the best and most experienced drummers can't 100% of the time keep
 a tempo for an extended period of time.
 However, there exists one simple trick that will allow you improve this
 ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
Subdivide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subdividing will allow you to retain the beat in your head for much longer
 and more accurate than if you were not to.
 Here's how you do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of counting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one, two, three, four
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as quarter notes in your head, try counting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one e and ah two e and ah three e and ah four e and ah
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as sixteenth notes in your head.
 By subdividing and counting the sixteenth notes instead, your brain has
 less discrepancy between each note and can therefore more reliably keep
 the tempo constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you count 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one, two, three, four,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your brain has to guess how much time to wait in between each word.
 As this duration increases, the less accurate this is.
 By reducing the amount of each time before you say the next word, you increase
 that accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the tempo is rapid and counting sixteenths is not practical, count eighths
 instead.

There are a few more important things to remember while holding the ictus
 position.
 The fingers should be held together; not clenched, but not spread apart
 either.
 The shoulders should be relaxed, back, and rested while the arms are parallel
 to the ground.
 The ictus shouldn't be too high or low, near chest height.
 The hands should extend forward from the shoulder and should not point
 in nor out.

The two triangles show the amount of teacher support (which is you!) and
 student responsibility.
 You read this chart by going from top to bottom.
 You'll notice that the triangles are divided into thirds.
 Each third is “I DO”, WE DO”, and “YOU DO”.
 These sections represent how you will move your knowledge of the skill
 to the student.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with “I DO”.
 You will begin by naming and demonstrating the fundamental.
 Talk about what the fundamental is, when you will use this, and give some
 context.
 Then, you can do a demonstration (often, you'll want to use a veteran or
 a Section Leader as the model).
 Start with the end product.
 So, if you're teaching how to stand at Attention, start by showing a proper
 Attention, so that the learner knows approximately what they will look
 like once they've learned it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've shown what it should look like, break it down step-by-step to
 explain the details of the skill.
 Go through and explain each part.
 If you're teaching a stationary fundamental, break it down into the parts
 of the body.
 If it involves movement—like moving to Parade Rest—you'll want to do this
 for each move.

\begin_layout Standard
Once you've broken it down, let them try it.
 Don't give any guidance yet.
 Just let them try it on their own and start to get comfortable with it.

 You can feel free to keep demonstrating it to help them try it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is it the appropriate time and place? Give feedback immediately if you notice
 a wrong behavior in a fundamental (e.g., stepping off on the right foot)
 and delay lengthier feedback and provide it when it is appropriate to do
 so.
 Do you give the feedback in public or in private? Think about the situation
 and determine when it is appropriate (it's not a good idea to tell someone
 they are misbehaving in the middle of a set, unless you deem it is emergent).

 Empower these individuals to hopefully change their thinking towards a
 positive attitude.

 so I won't provide a specific description for any one strut.
 But there are some guidelines to follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The mace should be slammed into the ground, on the right side of the Drum
 Major, on every beat 1 of each measure while in the cadence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Always be in sync with your co-Drum Major.
 Switch mace movement styles at the same time.
 There should be no more than 1 yoctosecond between the impact of your mace
 and your co-Drum Major's mace!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter exactly what movements you
 perform, just make sure it is the

 same thing your co-Drum Major is doing.
 Follow these rules and you are fine!

 The move for this is simple: on beat 4, place the toe of the left foot
 behind the right foot.
 On beat 1, pivot on both feet and turn the body 180° CCW.
 The upper body should remain motionless relative to the spin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To roll-off with the mace, raise it up in the air and hold the very bottom
 with your left hand, and grab about a foot higher with the right hand.
 Move your hands in alternating circles, effectively moving the dome of
 the mace in a large circle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To roll-off without the mace, point your finger in the sky and make large
 circles, making sure to have the arm bent at the elbow and moving.

\begin_layout Section
Keeping Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in Fundamental Block with the drum line, the Center Snare is there
 to assist you in keeping a metronome for the fundamentals.
 However, not always this will be at your convenience and you will need
 to keep the time yourself.
 There are several strategies to doing this, including clapping.

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to clap correctly to maximize the amplitude of the sound
 produced by striking the fingers and palms of your hands together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When clapping, you should not move your non-dominant hand.
 Your dominant hand should always go to the non-dominant hand.
 Slightly cup your non-dominant hand, as to make a small pocket of air when
 striking the palm with the fingers of the dominant hand.
 The thumb of the dominant hand should be slightly separated from the fingers
 and will rest below the wrist of the non-dominant hand on impact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the fingers of the dominant hand and part of the thumb are the
 only parts that touch the non-dominant hand; with reference from the tips
 of the fingers to the wrist, the last part that should touch lies around
 the metacarpophalangeal joints.

 is a powerful tool that allows you to do several things in many contexts

 In this section, I will cover the fundamentals of blowing the whistle,
 as well as where it will be used and what patterns to sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to Blow the Whistle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blowing the whistle is much similar to that of playing a wind instrument
 (since it is a wind instrument).
 Air pressure must be built in the lungs before a sound should be made.
 Use the tongue to stop the flow of air into the whistle by placing it on
 the opening of the whistle.
 Quickly release and repress the tongue on the mouthpiece of the whistle
 while maintaining air pressure to create a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tweet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 With practice this will sound more natural.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to manipulate the pitch of the tone by lowering and raising
 the air pressure into the whistle.
 This is used in different patterns to indicate messages.

Drum Majors will perform a 
\noun on
Salute
\noun default
 before each performance of a show.
 Since this is 100% directed by you and your co-Drum Major, I will not provide
 instructions for any specific salute.
 But, I will provide some tips that I learned while designing ours, as well
 as guidelines you should follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't do anything outside of your comfort zone.
 In general, this sounds like bad advice, but it is great advice in the
 context of your salute.
 Anything outside of your comfort zone makes you prone to messing up and
 making a mistake—not ideal.
 Choose some mace fundamentals that both you and your co-Drum Major are
 comfortable with and design your salute around that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You and your co-Drum Major must always be in sync during the salute.
 Sudden motions must occur at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prop spins—when done incorrectly—can become out of sync very quickly.
 Again, not ideal for a salute.
 If you have issues syncing your prop spins, keep them to a minimum, or
 don't do them at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have issues staying in sync, try gently counting out loud during
 the salute so your co-Drum Major can hear you and align themselves with
 you.
 Don't shout too loud though, or the audience will be able to hear you.

\begin_layout Standard
Again, when delivering commands, we must always be thinking about what is
 going maximize the effective travel distance of our delivery.
 The standard pitch at which you yell can affect this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is common for those with a deep voice (typically males) to raise their
 neutral speaking pitch to achieve this.
 The LO level of delivering may then rest around the common speaking pitch.
 Likewise, those with a higher voice (typically females) lower their voice.
 The HI level may then rest around common speaking pitch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When delivering commands, it's also important to maximize your volume, while
 also not damaging your vocal cords.
 An effective Drum Major shout relies more on diction and pitch more than
 volume, although still necessary.
 Commands will travel long distances when supported with enough air.
 Just like playing a wind instrument—building air pressure before playing—it
 is necessary to build pressure to ensure a well supported delivery with
 the diaphragm

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also important to know what you are going to say before you say it.
 This seems obvious, but is obvious when not considered.
 Cutting yourself off halfway through a delivery may not only confuse the
 band, but can also show that you're not confident in what you're going
 to say.
 If you accidentally start delivering the wrong command, commit to it and
 fix the error after you are finished.
 The band may not even realized you delivered the wrong command.
 If you commenced a drill (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

), you can emergency stop it by blowing a long whistle tone.
 Instruct the band to revert to the initial position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also know when it is appropriate to shout for delivery.
 If you are on the box (speaking into the microphone), you don't need to
 shout at full velocity.
 I recommend just loud-talking this to distinguish from normal banter, but
 not so loud you're damaging equipment or eardrums.

 When you need to say something to your co-Drum Major, a specific member
 of the band, or anyone else, be sure to turn off your transmitter before
 you begin talking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is important for two reasons.
 There are some things that the whole band does not need to hear.
 While you're telling a freshman that their feet need to be together at
 Attention, that freshman probably does not want the whole band hear you
 tell them that at an amplified volume that carries up to 1000 feet away.
 Turn the transmitter off.
 Also, you probably don't want the band to hear your remarks and other comments.
 When discussing with your co-Drum Major, turn the transmitter off.
 Only the things you want the band to hear need to be amplified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, just be careful about what you say.
 As Drum Major, you are expected to maintain a level of dignity and appropriaten
ess.
 But, like every other Drum Major out there, you're human and want to say
 what's truly on your mind.
 Pay extra attention to what you say while you are amplified and keep remarks
 in your head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you're on the mic, you can talk at a relatively normal volume.
 Don't deliver commands at full volume, just slightly louder than normal
 to distinguish from normal words (see Subsection

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Studying
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you're a Drum Major, it is probably a good idea to know what you are
 going to teach the band.
 Therefore, it's an important idea to study necessary information before
 band camp.
 There are three main things you should analyze and familiarize yourself
 with before attempting to instruct the ensemble: the charts, the scores,
 and the fundamentals.
 Having a firm understanding of these three facets will help you throughout
 the week and continuing into the school year.
 I've talked previously about teaching fundamentals and the prep work needed
 in order to properly teach this to the band (see Subsection
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:formula for effective teaching"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), so I will focus on the charts and scores for this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Charts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studying the charts will help you become more familiar with how the band
 should appear on the field and how the show is structured.
 For example, if a member comes up to you not knowing where they should
 be in a certain set, having a firm understanding—of not just how to read
 the chart, but the details and forms of 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 year's chart—will help you help them out quicker and get them on their
 dot.
 Lots of freshmen have a hard time understanding how to read their dotsheet
 (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Interpreting-Your-Dotsheet"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for specifics on this), so knowing the chart to confirm their position
 is handy.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
During my freshman year, I was on the wrong side of the field for probably
 30 minutes when we first started dotting the first set until I realized

\end_inset

 meant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The lesson to learn is this: don't assume freshmen know what they are doing;
 you don't want to make them feel lost—but have confidence in their ability
 to learn!
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, having the charts memorized will help you during rehearsal.
 Much of the time spent at band camp—when not practicing fundamentals, rehearsin
g music, or eating bagels and popsicles—is spent drilling the sets of the
 show, constantly going back and forth between sets.
 Knowing the measures and counts of each set—as well as what the band looks
 like in each set—can help speed up rehearsal, especially when Mr.
 Larsen says, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

go back to set 12,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and everyone goes, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

which measure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You studied the charts, you know which measure it is!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the visual appearance of the band on the field, the next most important
 feature of a marching band is the music.
 To have great music, everyone must know and be able to play their part
 well.
 So, what part do Drum Majors learn? Everyone's part! Knowing the scores
 will help you on the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having a strong command of the scores will indicate to you which parts and
 sections deserve the most attention and when.
 For example, during 2019's 
\emph on
Planes, Trains, and Automobiles
\emph default
, different songs required different conducting and cues depending on the
 song.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Low Rider
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 had heavy a trombone section, so it was important to cue trombones and
 conduct more specifically (since the trombones had the lead, or melody).
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Crazy Train
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 had special cues for tenor drums.
 The tenors played really interesting fills during some phrases in the song
 so it was important to emphasize it and cue it every time.
 Learning the scores goes hand-in-hand with learning the charts: knowing
 the measure numbers for sections in the song will be beneficial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How to study the scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An approach can be applied to analyzing and studying scores 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mark time signatures, tempos, dynamics, modulations, fermatas, etc.
 with a highlighter.
 Use different colors for each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Listen to recordings of the pieces and highlight the melody or focal element
 (which can change instrument, so do this bar by bar).
 Use a new color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Highlight areas to conduct differently or specially, including cues, crescendos,
 decrescendos, fermatas, etc.
 Use a new color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Translate your notations and markings into conducting styles.
 Use Laban elements and efforts to sculpt how you'll conduct each section.
 In the score, write down specifically how you'll execute this (exact efforts).

\begin_layout Standard
I developed it for one main reason: allowing Drum Majors and other leaders
 to quickly gather a resource to teach the band.
 It's often times that throughout the part of the marching season that overlaps
 with school, fundamental block warm up can become boring and invoke disinterest
edness in the band.
 This is not ideal since engagement should be kept high to help maintain
 motivation.
 DrillGen may help this by allowing Drum Majors to quickly present new material
 to the band.
 This way, the same drills aren't repeated every day and the band can improve
 their ability by working on challenging material.

\begin_layout Standard
DrillGen is best used when challenging the band.
 The app allows you to generate drills at varying levels of difficulty,
 so presenting

 up to

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 drills to the band can help the band practice essential fundamentals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start the session by warming up the band with a few simple drills.
 Either come up with some on your own or generate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beginner
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drills in the app.
 Ensure that the band has their attention on you and is ready to continue
 the rehearsal focused.
 Then begin to increase the difficulty.
 It is best to give the band drills that challenge them, but aren't impossible
 to complete.
 Practicing on that fine line between too easy and too hard yields most
 effective results and will allow the band to improve their skill most efficient
ly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would generate the day's drills with the app before the rehearsal.
 While the app is responsive and can generate drills with any set of parameters
 and customization options, generating them on the fly may not be ideal.
 By generating before rehearsal, this allows you to review the to-be-presented
 drills and become familiar with them yourself first.
 You may find that once you get on the field and start presenting the drills,
 the band finds it too easy or too hard—that's okay.
 The app generates a set of drills, so try and pick a different drill in
 the list that seems easier or harder.
